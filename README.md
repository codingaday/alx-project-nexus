# ALX Project Nexus: Backend Engineering ProDev Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my experience in the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering program. It serves as a central resource that captures the skills I built, the tools I mastered, and the practices I refined throughout the journey. Alongside technical exploration, it also reflects the challenges I encountered and the lessons I carried forward.  

## 1. Program Overview

The repository acts as both a learning archive and the official capstone documentation for the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering track. It brings together the concepts, solutions, and strategies I applied during the program, ultimately leading to the successful development of a fully functional **[Backend for a Job Board Platform]**, the cornerstone outcome of this journey.
